<p> Currently, we've completed our first build of our transmitter, however we are unable to receive the signal.<br>
    This is a problem, becasue it's extremely difficult to figure out where we went wrong.<br>
    Our solution for now is to rebuild the radio using a breadboard, which will give us more control in switching out parts and hopefully will help us find the issue. </p>
