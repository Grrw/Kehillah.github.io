    <center><h5>To Do List</h5></center>
    <p allign="center">
        <ul>
            <li>Connect External USB Monitor to Raspberry Pi and have it show terminal prompts</li>
            <li>Begin to write code in Python to read a joystick direction and print the output to terminal</li>
            <li>Connect the Joystick and learn how to use raspi imbedded GPIO pins</li>
            <li>Have the joystick move in 4 directions in X+, X- Y+ and Y- directions respecfully and print the
            direction the joystick is facing</li>
            <li>Once the Joystick works and is able to print to the terminal, we then will follow the same steps
            to have a button press print to terminal.</li>
            <li>Finally we then will work to integrate the code to have it run on startup</li>
            <li>Hopefully at that point, the arcade emulator will be good to go</li></ul>
    </p>
    <h6>Concerns</h6>
    <p>
        Our monitor is not supported by the rasberry pi so we are going to try one more idea and if it does not work we will use another screen. (It seems that we will use another monitor)
        We also will work on getting the games to run through retropi on a regular monitor.
        The standard monitor was able to boot to EmulationStation which is the backend program for running retroarch.
        We configured an Xinput controller to run onces the cores are loaded onto the pi</p>
